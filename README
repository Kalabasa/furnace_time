Time-sensitive Furnace Mod for Minetest
=======================================

This is a mod for Minetest.

This effectively makes the furnace work even when no one is around (when the furnace is unloaded).

The mod name is `furnace_time`.

This is somewhat a fork of `default:furnace` of minetest/minetest_game.
